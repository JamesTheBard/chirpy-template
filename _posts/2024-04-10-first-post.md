With a new blog means there's new content. After a few weeks of work, the initial version of the new Pathfinder 2nd Edition character sheet is out! The goal is to make a good pencil/paper character sheet that gets most of the important information on the first page.

To download the character sheet, just grab it from [here](/assets/files/pathfinder_character_sheet_2.0.0.pdf).

However, a quick warning: this character sheet will continue to change as I add pages to it.  For example, the **Proficiencies** section will probably move to page 2 and be replaced with a **Notes** section.
